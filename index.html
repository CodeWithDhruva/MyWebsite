            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is provided by public schools
                (controlled and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools.
                Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a
                fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5.
                India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary education.
                In 2011, Approximately 75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.
                7 India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic
                development.
                8 Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to
                various public institutions.
                At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government
                run schools,
                ith 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.11 Certain post-secondary
                technical school
                are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008
                , but is projected to be a US$40 billion market.12

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of
                higher learning in India from possibly 8th century BCE,
                and it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense,
                since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges,
                and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila,
                in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.
                Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university.
                There all subjects were taught in Ariano -páli Language.[23]
                Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical
                education,
                e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period between
                500 BCE to 400
                CE. The important urban centres of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar) and Manassa in Nagpur,
                among others.
                These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study
                topics
                such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli grammar, etc. Chanakya,
                a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan Empire.

                The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the "10+2" pattern of education.
                3 In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges(Mumbai,
                Maharashtra),
                44 and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree for college.
                The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education,
                6 years of High School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges.
                5 This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964–66.
                ucation Policy is prepared by the Centre Government and State Governments at national and state levels
                respectively
                . The National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, has provided for environment awareness, science and
                technology education,
                and introduction of traditional elements such as Yoga into the Indian secondary school system.
